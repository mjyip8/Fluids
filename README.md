# CS348C Assignment \#5: Position-Based Fluids
## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
I implemented a particle-based fluid simulator related to smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), based on the "Position Based Fluids" (PBF) approach described in [Macklin and Muller 2013](http://blog.mmacklin.com/publications/). I rendered my animations in Mitsuba and I also created an feature where you can change the position of one of the boxes walls while the simulation is going. You press the key 'J' to go to the left and the key 'K' to go to the right.
